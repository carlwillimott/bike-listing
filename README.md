# Bike Listing
This is a simple react application which uses redux to organise application state. The application state is persisted in localstorage using custom handlers, and will automatically hydrate when the page is reloaded. You can change the order of which the bikes are displayed by selecting an option from the list. Rather than sorting alphabetically, this creates almost a 'sticky' effect and shows corresponding items first. The actual application styling is very limited, but makes use of a simple bootstrap grid system to cater for varying screensizes.

## Getting Started
Install the required dependencies using `npm install` and then run the application using `npm start`.
